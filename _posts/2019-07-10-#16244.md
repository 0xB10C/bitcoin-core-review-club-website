title: "#16244 Move wallet creation out of the createwallet rpc into its own function (wallet)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16244](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16244)

## Notes

- This is a small refactor PR which makes [PR 15450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15450) (which [we reviewed a few weeks ago](https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15450.html)) simpler and cleaner.
- From that review club: "we try to make the RPC layer as thin as possible so functionality can be shared between RPC and QT". This PR applies that rule to the `createwallet` RPC method.
- There should be no behaviour change from this PR.

## Questions

- We ensure that refactors don't change behaviour by having the functionality covered by tests. Where is this functionality tested?
- Are all the failure modes tested? If not, why not?
- Where is the `warning` string used?
- There are several suggestions for changing the function from ryanofsky, promag and empact. Are those good suggestions?
