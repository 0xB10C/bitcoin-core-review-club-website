## Notes

Currently Bitcoin Core code always runs within a single operating system
[process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)). So if you are
running `bitcoind`, then you are running node and wallet code together in the
same process. If you are running `bitcoin-qt`, then you are running node,
wallet, and GUI code in the same process. Running all code in one process does
not provide a lot of isolation, so it means a crash in wallet code could bring
down the node, or a vulnerablility in the node could expose wallet data.
Additionally it's not possible to run the node and wallet on different machines,
or to stop and start the GUI independently of the node, or use the GUI to
connect to nodes or wallets on headless machines.

PR [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) starts to move away
from the single process model by adding basic support needed for bitcoin node,
wallet, and GUI code to run in different processes and communicate with each
other internally. Followups
[#19460](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460) and
[#19461](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461) expand on it to allow
wallet and GUI processes to be started and stopped independently, and allow the
processes to communicate with each other externally, and run on different
machines.

PR [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102), combined with the
`--enable-multiprocess` build option, builds a new `bitcoin-node` executable
that can be used as a drop-in replacement for `bitcoind`, and a new
`bitcoin-gui` executable that can be used a drop-in replacement of `bitcoin-qt`.
The new executables are used the same way as the previous ones and don't provide
any new features externally, but internally they will spawn multiple processes
and use process separation. Instructions for building and testing #10102 can be
found in
[`doc/multiprocess.md`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/doc/multiprocess.md#installation)
and can be done in a few commands on linux:

```bash
cd <BITCOIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>
make -C depends NO_QT=1 MULTIPROCESS=1
CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/share/config.site ./configure
make
src/bitcoin-node -regtest -printtoconsole -debug=ipc
```

When this is run, `bitcoin-node` will spawn a `bitcoin-wallet` executable to run
wallet code. The node and wallet processes will communicate across a socket,
with the node code controlling the wallet with
[`interfaces::WalletClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/interfaces/wallet.h#L310-L313)
methods, and the wallet code calling the node with
[`interfaces::Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/interfaces/chain.h#L92)
methods. Similarly when GUI support is enabled, `bitcoin-gui` will spawn a
`bitcoin-node` process, and control it by calling
[`interfaces::Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/interfaces/node.h#L63-L64)
methods, and control wallets by calling
[`interface::Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/interfaces/wallet.h#L52-L53)
methods.

#10102 adds the plumbing that allows gui <-> node <-> wallet cross-process
communication to work transparently, *without changing existing code, only
adding new code*. This is possible because the interfaces in `src/interfaces/`
(`interfaces::Chain`, `interfaces::Node`, `interfaces::Wallet` described above)
are all abstract classes with virtual methods, so different implementations can
be substituted without changes to calling code. This PR adds new implementations
of each interface that forward method calls from one process to another. In
early versions of this PR, adding new implementations of each interface required
adding a lot of boilerplate code. Every method in every interface, and every
argument and return value of every method had to had custom C++ code written
that would handle the method call serialization and forwarding from the calling
process to the called process. For example, the
[`Wallet::encryptWallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.19/src/ipc/interfaces.h#L275)
abstract method:

```c++
    virtual bool encryptWallet(const SecureString& wallet_passphrase) = 0;
```

had an
[`ipc::capnp::WalletImpl::encryptWallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.19/src/ipc/capnp/interfaces.cpp#L205-L213)
implmentation which forwarded the encrypt call from the gui process to the
wallet process using the [Cap'n Proto RPC
framework](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html):

```c++
    bool encryptWallet(const SecureString& wallet_passphrase) override
    {
        auto call = MakeCall(m_loop, [&]() {
            auto request = m_client.encryptWalletRequest();
            request.setWalletPassphrase(ToArray(wallet_passphrase));
            return request;
        });
        return call.send([&]() { return call.m_response->getResult(); });
    }
```

with corresponding code in an [`ipc::capnp::WalletServer::encryptWallet`
method](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.19/src/ipc/capnp/server.cpp#L102-L107)
in the wallet process to handle the incoming RPC:

```c++
    kj::Promise<void> encryptWallet(EncryptWalletContext context) override
    {
        context.getResults().setResult(
            m_impl->encryptWallet(ToSecureString(context.getParams().getWalletPassphrase())));
        return kj::READY_NOW;
    }
```

by forwarding it to the local [`ipc::local::WalletImpl::encryptWallet`
method](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.19/src/ipc/local/interfaces.cpp#L150-L153):

```c++
    bool encryptWallet(const SecureString& wallet_passphrase) override
    {
        return m_wallet.EncryptWallet(wallet_passphrase);
    }
```

which is the same method that would have been called directly if code were
running in a single process instead of multiple processes.

Because the `ipc::capnp::WalletImpl::encryptWallet` and
`ipc::capnp::WalletServer::encryptWallet` methods above and all similar methods
just contain boilerplate code forwarding arguments and return values, newer
versions of this PR no longer define these methods manually, and instead
generate them automatically. (You can see these methods in generated
`src/ipc/capnp/wallet.capnp.proxy-client.c++` and
`src/ipc/capnp/wallet.capnp.proxy-server.c++` files after building this PR, but
they are not part of the PR source code). The code generation means that adding
a new method or changing an existing method signature now just requires editing
a single line in the interface's
[`.capnp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/ipc/capnp/wallet.capnp#L20)
file:

```capnproto
    encryptWallet @1 (context :Proxy.Context, walletPassphrase :Data) -> (result :Bool);
```

and the corresponding forwarding code is generated from that.

Library support for everything described above was merged previously in [#19160
Multiprocess: Add basic spawn and IPC
support](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19160) ([review
club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19160)), so the most significant part of
#10102 is just adding `.capnp` interfaces for all the interfaces in
[`src/ipc/capnp/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc.168/src/ipc/capnp).

#10102 is a large PR and it is divided into multiple commits.

The most significant commits are the "Add canp serialization..." and "Add capnp
wrapper..." commits which add [Cap'n Proto schema
definitions](https://capnproto.org/language.html) describing Bitcoin's struct
and interface types that are shared between processes:
([common.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/ipc/capnp/common.capnp),
[chain.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/ipc/capnp/chain.capnp),
[node.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/ipc/capnp/node.capnp),
[wallet.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.168/src/ipc/capnp/wallet.capnp)).
These commits also add a lot of glue code in `BuildField` / `ReadField`/
`BuildMessage` / `ReadMessage` function. There is a lot of ugly C++ template
syntax needed to declare the function types, but the actual function bodies are
pretty straightforward and just copy information between Bitcoin Core's native
data structures and corresponding capnp messages.

The other two significant commits in this PR are the "Make bitcoin-gui spawn a
bitcoin-node process" commit and "Make bitcoin-node spawn a bitcoin-wallet
process" commit. These commits don't add much new code. Instead they strip out
wallet initialiatation code from the `BitcoinNodeInit` class (so the
`bitcoin-node` process no longer has wallet functionality linked in) and strip
out node and wallet initialization code from the `BitcoinGuiInit` class (so the
`bitcoin-gui` class no longer has node and wallet functionality linked in. Then
they add `spawnProcess` calls in appropriate places to start making
cross-process calls. A good entry point into these two commits is to search for
the new `spawnProcess` calls they add.

The other commits in this PR are needed for completeness but aren't related to
its core functionality. They are smaller and just update dependencies, logging,
and test code.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are some disadvantages of separating bitcoin node, wallet, and GUI into separate processes?
   What are some benefits?

3. Did you try building with `--enable-multiprocess` ? And did you try running with `debug=1` to
   view IPC logging?

4. Why is it important that Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the
   `src/ipc/capnp/` directory, and not in any other public header files?

5. What is the difference between node and wallet running on different processes vs different
   threads? Why must they communicate via an IPC framework instead of calling each other's functions
   normally?

6. Where are the `spawnProcess` calls added in the "Make bitcoin-gui spawn..." and "Make
   bitcoin-node spawn..." commits? What type of interface pointer is requested from each of the
   spawned processes?
