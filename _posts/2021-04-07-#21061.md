## Notes

* Hiding links between wallet addresses and IP addresses is a key part of
  Bitcoin privacy. Many techniques exist to help users obfuscate their IP
  address when submitting their own transactions, and various P2P changes have
  been proposed with the goal of hiding transaction origins.

* Beyond initial broadcast, _rebroadcast_ behavior can also leak information. If
  a node rebroadcasts its own wallet transactions differently from transactions
  received from its peers, adversaries can use this information to infer
  transaction origins even if the initial broadcast revealed nothing. We have
  discussed rebroadcast in previous review clubs,
  [#16698](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16698) and
  [#18038](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18038).

* The rebroadcast project's goal is to improve privacy by making node
  rebroadcast behavior for wallet transactions indistinguishable from that of
  other peers' transactions.

* [#21061](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061) adds a `TxRebroadcast`
  module responsible for selecting transactions to be rebroadcast and keeping
  track of how many times each transaction has been rebroadcast.  After each
  block, the module uses the miner and other heuristics to select transactions
  from the mempool that it believes "should" have been included in the block and
  reannounces them (disabled by default for now).

* Rebroadcasts happen once per new block. The set of transactions to be
  rebroadcast is calculated as follows:

    - The node regularly estimates the minimum feerate for transactions to be
      included in the next block, `m_cached_fee_rate`.

    - When a new block arrives, the transactions included in the block are
      removed from the mempool. The node then uses `BlockAssembler` to calculate
      which transactions (with a total weight up to 3/4 of the block maximum)
      from the mempool are more than 30 minutes old and have a minimum feerate
      of `m_cached_fee_rate`. This results in a set of transactions that our
      node would have included in the last block.

    - The rebroadcast attempt tracker, `m_attempt_tracker`, tracks how many
      times and how recently we've attempted to rebroadcast a transaction so
      that we don't spam the network with re-announcements.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. In what scenarios might a user want to rebroadcast their transaction? Why
   shouldn't each wallet just be solely responsible for rebroadcasting its own
   transactions?

3. How does the rebroadcast module decide which transactions to rebroadcast
   (`TxRebroadcastHandler::GetRebroadcastTransactions()`)?

4. In what scenarios would a miner include different transactions from our
   `BlockAssembler`? More specifically, when might the miner exclude a
   transaction, and when might it include a transaction yours doesn't?

5. Why might we want to keep a transaction in our rebroadcast attempt tracker
   even after removing it from our mempool?  (Hint: what happens if we expire a
   transaction from our mempool and then our peer rebroadcasts it to us? When
   might this happen?)

6. When should we remove transactions from our rebroadcast attempt tracker? How
   does the code ensure that the tracker doesn't grow unbounded?

7. How is the estimated minimum feerate for inclusion in a block,
   `m_cached_fee_rate`, calculated? Why not just calculate the feerate of the
   lowest-feerate transaction in the most recently mined block?
