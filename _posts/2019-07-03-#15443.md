title: "#15443 Add getdescriptorinfo functional test (tests)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15443](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15443)

## Notes

- *Output script descriptor* are a language for describing individual
  scriptPubKeys or HD chains of scriptPubKeys. See the [Bitcoin Core
  documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).

- [PR 15368](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15368) added *checksums*
  to descriptors. Since descriptors contain private or public keys where a
  transcription error can lead to loss of funds, having to checksum to ensure
  correct transcription is a sensible precaution.

- Those checksums are based on a similar BCH encoding scheme as the bech32
  address format. There are [very detailed
  comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4db2f8cf0f63cf2a130e238d59f5b6032420f83d/src/script/descriptor.cpp#L24)
  in the implementation explaining how the checksum is calculated.

- The PR also added a new RPC method `getdescriptorinfo` that can be called
  with a descriptor to analyse the descriptor and add the checksum. That RPC
  method:
    - is a _pure function_. It has no side effects.
    - doesn't need access to any blockchain or mempool data
    - doesn't have access to the wallet.

- The PR also added [unit
  tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15368/files#diff-12adb018d1839fb955f130aa2b1e22e6)
  and updated several functional tests to use the checksums. A [python
  implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15368/files#diff-8b0b13a0c8c32f5333fcd7217cc9cd2e)
  of the checksum was also added.

- PR #15443 adds functional tests specifically for the new `getdescriptorinfo` RPC method.

## Questions

- What type of testing is used in Bitcoin Core?

- What are the uses for unit tests and functional tests?

- What is meant by *solvable* when talking about a descriptor?

- Why are address and raw type descriptors always unsolvable?
