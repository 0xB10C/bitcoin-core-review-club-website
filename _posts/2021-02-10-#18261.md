In this PR Review Club meeting, we'll discuss
[BIP330](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)
and the high-level concepts behind Erlay.

We'll also look at the first few net processing commits in more detail:

- [Announce reconciliation support](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/6103b5cdcec775c77ac47b550bfc0b979d53b051)
- [Handle reconciliation support announcement](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/34a485e0f1c9511fbd18cc6c0d60b6ca8929ccd9)
- [Limit transaction flooding](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/aff98fcc1e83615b9bdff4a240898d15231d5f94)
- [Remove node from reconciliation queue when disconnecting](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f24c51e452ef3f7562e44422abd7b3162b0b13c8)

## Notes

- Erlay is a proposal for a new method of transaction relay based on a
  combination of flooding and reconciliation (the current transaction relay is
  flooding-only).  The idea was presented in a 2019 paper, *[Bandwidth-Efficient
  Transaction Relay for Bitcoin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518)*, and is
  specified in
  [BIP330](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki).

- Reconciliation works asymmetrically in Erlay, depending on the direction of
  the connection. When we interact with an outbound peer (i.e. we initiated the
  connection), we are the requester of a reconciliation, and our peer is the
  responder (vice versa when interacting with an inbound peer).

- In the simplest scenario, being a requestor means that we send a
  reconciliation (message REQRECONCIL), receive an answer back (SKETCH), and
  reply with the reconciliation differences (RECONCILDIFF) that we can extract
  by comparing our sketch with the received one.  At this point, both parties
  know the set of transactions their peers might require that are known to both.

- A sketch is a representation of a set of transactions (or their short IDs)
  that is optimized for a specified space. Erlay implements an existing set
  reconciliation algorithm called PinSketch.

- Erlay does not completely abandon flooding but uses it much more sparingly.
  Nodes will still flood certain transactions to a limited number of peers; the
  goal is that only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood
  transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What advantages does a reconciliation-based approach to transaction relay
   have over the current flooding method. What are the trade-offs?

3. Which of the existing message types participating in transaction relay will
   be sent less often with Erlay? Which ones will be unaffected?

4. Can you explain _why_ a reconciliation-based approach scales better than flooding
   (after all, the reconciliation messages also consume regular traffic)?

5. How do two peers reach agreement about whether to use reconciliation?

6. If two peers have agreed to use reconciliation, does that mean there will
   be no flooding on this connection?

7. In the [Limit transaction
   flooding](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261/commits/aff98fcc)
   commit, `MAX_OUTBOUND_FLOOD_TO` is set to 8. Considering that 8 is also the
   maximum number of outbound connections participating in transaction relay,
   why do you think this value was chosen?

8. Can you think of possible new attack vectors that would specifically apply
   to Erlay?
