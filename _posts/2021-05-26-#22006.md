## Notes

### Context

- User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) allows peeking into runtime
  internals at statically defined tracepoints of user-space applications
  (Bitcoin Core in our case).
- Build support and `TRACEx` macros based on
  [systemtaps](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki) `sys/sdt.h` for USDT were
  merged in [PR19866](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19866).
- Issue [#20981](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20981) discusses
  potential tracepoints.

### Tracepoints and tracing scripts

- We can hook into the tracepoints with tracing scripts via the Linux kernel.
- If we don't hook into the tracepoints, then they are
  [NOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)) and have little to no
  performance impact.
- The tracepoints can pass data back to the tracing script, which contains the
  tracing logic, e.g. to collect statistics, print or visualize data, give
  alerts, etc.
- Tracepoints need to be somewhat generic to allow for reusability in different
  tracing scripts, but they also need a clear use case. There is no need to
  plaster the code with (unused) tracepoints.
- There are currently two main tools for writing USDT scripts and other tools
  are under development:
  - [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) for one-liners and short
    scripts
  - [BPF compiler collection (BCC)](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc), e.g. with
    the Python wrapper for complex scripts

### eBPF under the hood

- Hooking into these tracepoints works via a technology called
  [eBPF](https://ebpf.io). Think of it as a small virtual machine (VM) in your
  Linux kernel where you can run sandboxed eBPF programs (even if there is a
  problem with your eBPF program, it can't crash or otherwise harm your kernel).
- The tracing scripts compile and then load eBPF bytecode into this VM. When
  attached to a tracepoint, the eBPF program is called with the arguments passed
  to the tracepoint.
- Based on your use case, the eBPF program can, for example, filter the data or
  pass it along to the tracing logic in the tracing script. The eBFP VM is quite
  limited. For example, it has a stack size of 512 bytes.

1. The tracing script compiles the eBPF code and loads the eBFP program into a kernel VM
2. The eBPF program hooks into one or more tracepoints
3. When the tracepoint is called, the arguments are passed to the eBPF program
4. The eBPF program processes the arguments and returns data to the tracing script
```

### Examples

- The PR includes examples and documentation on how to run them.
- For building Bitcoin Core with USDT support, you need the `sys/sdt.h` headers
  (when present, USDT support is [automatically] compiled in). On Debian-like
  systems you can install the package `systemtap-sdt-dev` (this is not yet
  documented in the PR).
- As an exercise for reviewers: You can try to build Bitcoin Core with USDT
  support, list the available tracepoints (see `doc/tracing.md`), try out the
  example scripts (see `contrib/tracing.md`), and even add a custom tracepoint
  and tracing script.

## Questions

1. What is the difference between USDT and using an `uprobe` to trace Bitcoin
   Core? What do they have in common? Why do we add tracepoints if we can just
   use `uprobes`? (Hint: see [this
   comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19866#issuecomment-689162173)
   and the following ones in
   [PR19866](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19866).)

2. Why shouldn't we do any "expensive" operations just to pass extra data into
   tracepoints? What are examples of such expensive operations?

3. Why are root privileges required to run tracing scripts?

4. What is eBPF (aka BPF), and how do we utilize it for USDT?

5. For debugging and monitoring of the peer-to-peer code, it can be useful to
   log the raw P2P message bytes. Is this possible with USDT and eBPF? What are
   limiting factors? Why?

6. Discussion: Should USDT be supported in Bitcoin Core release builds?

7. Discussion: Do you have ideas for places where static tracepoints make sense?
   See issue [#20981](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20981) for
   inspiration.

8. Discussion: Can the tracepoints be automatically tested? Could they even help
   in functional testing?
