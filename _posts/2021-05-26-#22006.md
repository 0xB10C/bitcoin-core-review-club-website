## Notes

### Context

- User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) allows peeking into runtime internals at statically defined tracepoints of user-space applications (Bitcoin Core in our case).
- Build support and `TRACEx` macros based on [systemtaps] `sys/sdt.h` for USDT were merged in [#19866].
- Issue [#20981] discusses potential tracepoints.

### Tracepoints and tracing scripts

- We can hook into the tracepoints with tracing scripts via the Linux kernel.
- If we don't hook into the tracepoints, then they are [NOPs] and have little to no performance impact.
- The tracepoints can pass data back to the tracing script, which contains the tracing logic, e.g. to collect statistics, print or visualize data, give alerts, etc..
- Tracepoints need to be somewhat generic to allow for reusability in different tracing scripts, but they also need a clear use case. There is no need to plaster the code with (unused) tracepoints.
- There are currently two main tools for writing USDT scripts:
  - [bpftrace] for one-liners and short scripts
  - [BPF compiler collection (BCC)] e.g. with the Python wrapper for complex scripts
Other tools with USDT support are under development.

### eBPF under the hood

- Hooking into these tracepoints works via a technology called [eBPF]. Think of it as a small virtual machine (VM) in your Linux kernel where you can run sandboxed eBPF programs (even if there is a problem with your eBPF program, it can't crash or otherwise harm your kernel).
- The tracing scripts compile and then load eBPF bytecode into this VM. When attached to a tracepoint, the eBPF program is called with the arguments passed to the tracepoint.
- Based on your use case, the eBPF program can, for example, filter the data or pass it along to the tracing logic in the tracing script. The eBFP VM is quite limited. For example, it has a stack size of 512 bytes.

1. The tracing script compiles the eBPF code and loads the eBFP program into a kernel VM
2. The eBPF program hooks into one or more tracepoints
3. When the tracepoint is called, the arguments are passed to the eBPF program
4. The eBPF program processes the arguments and returns data to the tracing script
```

### Examples

- The PR includes examples and documentation on how to run them.
- For building Bitcoin Core with USDT support, you need the `sys/std.h` headers (when present, USDT support is [automatically] compiled in). On Debian-like systems you can install the package`systemtap-sdt-dev` (this is not documented yet).
- As an exercise for reviewers: You can try to build Bitcoin Core with USDT support, list the avaliable tracepoints (see `doc/tracing.md`), try out the example scripts (see `contrib/tracing.md`), and even add a custom tracepoint and tracing script.
