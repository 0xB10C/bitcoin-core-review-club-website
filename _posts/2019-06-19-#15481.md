title: "#15481 Restrict timestamp when mining a diff-adjustment block to prev-600 (mining)"

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15481](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15481)

## Notes

- This PR was proposed in preparation for Matt Corallo's _Great Consensus
  Cleanup_ softfork proposal. ([Mailing list
  post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016714.html)),
  ([proposed
  BIP](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/cleanup-softfork/bip-XXXX.mediawiki)).
- The [proposal was
  discussed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016714.html)
  at the recent Bitcoin Core devtech meetup.
- This PR is connected with the _timewarp_ fix part of the BIP: _By further
  restricting nTime fields on difficulty adjustment blocks, we propose fixing
  the long-standing "timewarp" inflation vulnerability in Bitcoin's difficulty
  adjustment without risking existing mining hardware becoming unusable. This
  limits the worst-case difficulty adjustment target in case of attack from the
  current exponential growth, to once every roughly 600 seconds._
- The expected time period of 2016 blocks (one retargetting period) isn't
  exactly two weeks. See [this thread from Pieter
  Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1098651788343955456) on why exactly
  that is.
- The PR doesn't enforce that consensus change. Rather, it changes the mining
  behaviour of a Bitcoin Core node to be compliant with the proposed changes.
- There are two changes:
    - One to `getblocktemplate` (the RPC that a miner calls in order to get a
      template block to work on). This PR changes the returned `mintime`
      field returned by `getblocktemplate`, such that if the next block is a
      difficulty adjustment block, it is constrained by the prev-600 rule.
    - One to `UpdateTime()`, which is called when creating a new block (either
      for mining on the node for regtest, or for `getblocktemplate`).
- At the time of writing, this PR is 'Chasing Concept ACK'. That means that
  we want contributors to review the concept before reviewing the implementation.

## Questions

- What could a miner do by abusing the timestamp field in a difficulty adjustment
  block prior to the Great Consensus Cleanup change?
- After the Great Consensus Cleanup change, what can a miner do by abusing the
  block timestamp?
- Why not just enforce that difficulty adjustment blocks to have a timestamp after
  the previous block, rather than after prev-600?
- Which function would need to be changed to enforce this timestamp restriction
  as a consensus rule?
- The `curtime` return value of `getblocktemplate` is now constrained by the
  prev-600 rule. Why?
