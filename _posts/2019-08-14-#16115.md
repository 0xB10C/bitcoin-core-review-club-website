title: "#16115 On bitcoind startup, write config args to debug.log (config)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16115](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16115)

## Notes

- Configuration options can either be specified in a config file or passed as command-line arguments to the bitcoind or bitcoin-qt executable.
- Config file and command line configuration interact in complex ways. See [PR 15934](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15934) for a full treatment of how configuration options are merged and parsed.
- The configuration options affect node behaviour at runtime in various ways.
- When debugging or troubleshooting node issues, it's very useful to know what configuration was applied to the node, but that information is not always available.
- This PR prints the config file and command line configuration to the debug.log file on startup.
- The PR was later updated to also reprint configuration options when the log file rotates.

## Questions

- In a [review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15934), Carl Dong suggests that it'd be "very useful to have the **effective** command line configuration at-a-glance". How does this differ from what has been implemented in this PR? Why would it be difficult to implement?
- Reviewers asked the PR author to add a blacklist of configuration that shouldn't be logged. The author implemented that [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16115/files#diff-c9721a8bab21576f98fa79fda2715408R967). What are your thoughts about that implementation of a blacklist?
- What is Bitcoin Core log shrinking? Where is it implemented?
- What is log rotation? How can it be used for Bitcoin Core logs?
- What is the purpose of the second commit in this PR (_[re-log configuration when debug.log is reopened](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16115/commits/aac50df4187f92fc6254182354e1b135aa738fe7)_)? What are your thoughts about that additional functionality?
- What tests are included in this PR? Could any additional tests be added?
