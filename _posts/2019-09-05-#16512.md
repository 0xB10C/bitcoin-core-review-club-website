title: "#16512 Shuffle inputs and outputs after joining psbts (RPC)"
---

Today's PR is very small and should be a quick review. We'll spend half the
time talking about the PR and half covering general questions about the Bitcoin
Core review process.

Please come prepared with your own questions about review in Bitcoin Core!

## Notes

- Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) are a way for Bitcoin wallets
  and applications to pass unsigned or partially-signed transactions around.
- This is useful needed when a transaction requires multiple signatures (eg for
  a multisig output or an off-chain contract).
- The PSBT format is defined in [BIP
  174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki). The BIP
  also defines several _responsibilities_ in the PSBT workflow: creator, updater,
  signer, combiner, input finalizer, and transaction extractor.
- The
  [`joinpsbts`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d3e672119e80b04f15548b5bfae279cd722eac24/src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp#L1549)
  RPC utility method takes multiple PSBTs and joins them into a single PSBT.
- Currently, the inputs and outputs are joined in order. This PR changes the
  method to shuffle both inputs and outputs.

## Questions

- What is the justification for this PR? Why would users want inputs/outputs to
  be shuffled?
