## Notes

- There are a variety of different types of P2P connections that Bitcoin Core nodes
  can have with peers. See the `ConnectionType` enum in `src/net.h` for the different
  types.

- Until now, the Bitcoin Core functional test framework allowed only 2 types of
  P2P connections:
  - _manual_ connections from one bitcoind instance to another. See the
    `BitcoinTestFramework.connect_nodes()` method, which calls the `addnode` RPC.
  - _inbound_ connections made from the test framework to the bitcoind
    instance. See the `TestNode.add_p2p_connection()` method.

- This week's PR adds the ability to create 2 additional types of regtest P2P
  connections from the bitcoind instances to the functional test framework:
  - _full outbound_ connections
  - _block-relay-only_ outbound connections

- The PR adds functionality to both the bitcoind C++ code and to the functional
  test framework Python code:
  - In bitcoind, a test-only `addconnection` RPC is added to allow opening
    full outbound or block-relay-only outbound connections in regtest.
  - In the functional test framework, `TestNode.add_outbound_p2p_connection()`
    is added to enable making either full outbound or block-relay-only outbound
    connections, along with `P2PInterface.peer_accept_connection()` to allow the
    test framework to accept and listen to incoming connections.

  We'll focus mainly on the C++ code in this review club.

## Questions

1. What are Bitcoin Core's different connection types?

2. In the test framework, what is the difference between connecting two
   bitcoind nodes and using a P2P connection?

3. Why would it be useful to create outbound or block-relay-only connections in
   the test framework?

4. How does this PR enable creating outbound and block-relay-only connections
   in the test framework?

5. Why do we make some RPC methods hidden, or "test only"?

6. For each different type of connection, what is the maximum number of
   connections that Bitcoin Core will have by default?

7. What are `CSemaphore` and `CSemaphoreGrant` used for in `CConnman`?
