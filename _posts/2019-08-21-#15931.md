title: "#15931 Remove GetDepthInMainChain dependency on locked chain interface (wallet)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931)

## Notes

- This PR is the latest in a sequence of PRs to clean up the node-wallet
  interface.
- We [previously reviewed PR
  15713](https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15713.html) in Bitcoin Core
  review club. See the notes and logs for that meeting for more information
  about the interface and the recent work to tidy it up.
- One of the main goals of that work is to remove the wallet's ability to lock
  `cs_main`.  [PR 16426](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426) is a
  proof-of-concept PR which does that.
- This PR is a big step towards removing the wallet's ability (and requirement)
  to lock `cs_main`. It removes the `locked_chain` dependency from the
  `CWalletTx::GetDepthInMainChain()` function.
- For a given wallet transaction, `GetDepthInMainChain()` returns how many
  confirmations that transaction has in the block chain.
- When a wallet transaction is included in a block, the block's hash is stored
  in the `CWalletTx` object (see `hashBlock` and `SetMerkleBranch()`.
- `GetDepthInMainChain()` previously worked by taking that `hashBlock` and
  checking its depth in the block chain. That requires locking `cs_main` since
  block chain state is being accessed.
- After this PR, each wallet transaction stores the height of the block that
  it was confirmed in, and the wallet stores the height of the best block
  in the block chain. By storing these values internally, the wallet no
  longer needs to query the block chain state to calculate the transaction's
  number of confirmation.
- Part of this PR has been split off into a separate PR, [wallet: encapsulate
  transactions state](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16624) to make
  review easier. Reviewers should leave comments on that PR before reviewing
  this PR.

## Questions

- An early version of this PR added an `m_block_height` field the wallet
  transaction serialization
  [(comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931#discussion_r295434058).
  Why wouldn't this work?
- The PR author offers [two ways for the wallet to populate the wallet
  transactions'
  heights](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931#issuecomment-518951928)
  (save the transaction height to disk or calculate the height for each
  transactions at wallet load time). What are the trade-offs? Which approach do
  you prefer?
- How does the wallet learn about new transactions in the mempool or included
  in blocks?
- What are the wallet's expectations about block notifications? Is it a problem
  if the wallet is informed of the same block more than once? If blocks arrive
  in the wrong order? If a block is skipped? If a block is re-orged out of the
  main chain?
