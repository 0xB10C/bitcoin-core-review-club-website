## Notes

### Context

- The author of this PR, [Suhas Daftuar](https://github.com/sdaftuar), has been
  working to improve the privacy and resilience of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer
  network. [See his PR
  history](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asdaftuar).

- This PR builds on [PR #17951](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17951)
  "Use rolling bloom filter of recent block txs for AlreadyHave() check" by the
  same author, which was just merged.

- Suhas wrote a BIP draft that this PR implements: [WTXID-based transaction
  relay](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/2020-02-wtxid-relay/bip-wtxid-relay.mediawiki).

### What is a `wtxid`?

- [BIP
  141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#specification)
  (Segregated Witness) introduced the definition of `wtxid`:
    - "A new wtxid is defined: the double SHA256 of the new serialization with
      witness data."
    - "If all txins (transaction inputs) are not witness program, a transaction's
      wtxid is equal to its txid."

- [PR #11203](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11203) added `wtxid` to
  the mempool entry output of `entryToJSON()` in `src/rpc/blockchain.cpp`,
  thereby exposing wtxids to callers in the output of RPCs `getmempoolentry`,
  `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolancestors`, and `getrawmempool`.

### WTXID-based transaction relay

- Using the txid (which does not include the witness) is problematic because
  the witness can be malleated without changing the txid. See
  [#8279](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8279) for a full discussion
  of the issue.

- The [PR description](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044#issue-369668879)
  contains a very full and clear description of the motivation and changes.

## Questions

- Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK \<commit\>, or
  NACK?](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core#peer-review)&nbsp;
  Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub or [ask
  questions](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core#ask-questions).

- Describe `recentRejects`: what type of data structure is it, what data does
  it contain, and what is it used for? (Hint: `git grep -ni rejects`).

- In your opinion, does this PR save bandwidth for older nodes talking to newer
  nodes? What about downloading from old and new peers alike?

- According to commit
  [61e2e97](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044/commits/61e2e97),
  using both txid and wtxid-based relay with peers means that we could sometimes
  download the same transaction twice, if announced via 2 different hashes from
  different peers. What do you think of the heuristic of delaying
  txid-peer-GETDATA requests by 2 seconds, if we have at least one wtxid-based
  peer?

- In [this
  comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044#discussion_r373775416),
  Suhas mentions a possible race condition where a peer could send a txid-based
  INV to us before it gets this message, which would cause relay of that
  transaction to fail. Do you agree?

- Do you see any other potential race conditions (or DoS vectors)?

- Overall, do you think the potential benefits of these changes merit the
  additional complexity and data storage (if any)?
