## Notes

- On 10 November 2019, [bitcoinVBR](https://github.com/bitcoinVBR) opened [PR
17433](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17433) "fix
nMinerConfirmationWindow not initialized". The PR was misunderstood as a style
change and closed by a maintainer.

- On 12 November, bitcoinVBR insisted by opening a similar change in [PR
17448](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17448) "remove unused variable-
consensus.nMinerConfirmationWindow". Despite what looked like a bad merge by the
author while making the PR, it became clear to the maintainers that this was
more than a style change.

- A third try the same day, [PR
17449](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449) "fix uninitialized
variable nMinerConfirmationWindow", was merged. It was for this 2-line fix that
the Bitcoin Core [0.19.0.1 patch
release](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/0.19) was made.

- What was the issue? An uninitialized read in [PR
16713](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16713), merged 27 September 2019,
that got past review by more than a half dozen reviewers (and also [your
host](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16713#pullrequestreview-291029801)
today).

- How did it escape detection?
  - The uninitialized read (of nMinerConfirmationWindow) took place [on mainnet
and testnet but not on
regtest](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449#issuecomment-552843096).
  - Memory sanitizer [was not
enabled](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449#issuecomment-552889851)
in the tests and CI.
  - [The compilers were "fixing" our
code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449#issuecomment-552901592) in
both Clang and GCC with the Bitcoin Core default setting of `-O2`.

- On 30 October, [PR 15921](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15921) -- [a
 review club PR](http://localhost:4000/15921.html) with quite a few ACKs -- was
 merged which contained another uninitialized read. Bitcoin Core contributor
 [practicalswift](https://github.com/practicalswift) found the issue by
 compiling Bitcoin with `-fsanitize=memory` and with valgrind, which both caught
 the issue. It was fixed in [PR
 17624](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17624).

- On 29 November, practicalswift opened [PR
17633](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17633) to enable running
the functional tests with valgrind, which was recently merged.

- The valgrind `--exit-on-first-error=yes` option is available since version
3.14 on Linux. Valgrind support on macOS may be more limited. [A PR is
open](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17732) to automate setting that
exit flag when running functional tests with valgrind.

- On 30 November, practicalswift opened today's [PR
17639](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17639) to enable running the unit
tests with valgrind.

### Consequences of uninitialized variables

- Uninitialized stack variables are Undefined Behaviour (UB), a typical outcome
  of which is reading stale stack or register values. In the best case, the
  compiler auto-fixes it or it generates an unexpected result. In the worst
  case, an exploit may be created that leaks secrets by allowing use of an
  attacker-controlled value.

### What can we do to mitigate uninitialized variables?

- Recommended reading: the discussion in [PR
  17627](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17627) "Suppress false positive
  warning about uninitialized entropy buffers".

- Test/fuzz/review better... or just write perfect code.
  - We do these things (test, fuzz, and review), but the recent issues show that
    it's not enough.
  - Attackers may find what programmers don't think of, and what fuzzers don't
    hit.

- Compile with `-Werror=uninitialized` and fix all uninitialized variables in
  the codebase.
  - A fair amount of code to change.
  - The value chosen to initialize doesn't necessarily make sense.
  - Code doesn't express intent anymore.
  - Similarly, static analysis isn't smart enough.

- Use memory sanitizer or valgrind.
  - Requires compiling everything in the process with memory sanitizer.
  - Can't deploy in production.
  - Several times slower and memory-hungry.

- Pre-initialize variables with dummy values, e.g. compile with Clang `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern`.
  - Raises [testing sensitivity
  concerns](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17627#issuecomment-562387426).
  - If a flaw is introduced, it may be undetectable by valgrind.
  - Compilers can warn when they're certain a value will be
    undefined, and pre-emptive dummy initialization breaks those warnings.
  - Valgrind has special macros that can be used to mark memory as undefined. It
    may be best if dummy initialization were to be always done via a macro that
    would allow disabling it for testing, or valgrind annotating it.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK \<commit\>, or
  NACK?](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#peer-review)&nbsp;
  Were you able to run the unit tests with valgrind? Don't forget to put your PR
  review on GitHub or [ask
  questions](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md#ask-questions).

2. Have you tried reproducing and catching the uninitialized read errors that
   were found?

3. Which options do you use -- or plan to begin using -- to catch these?

4. What would be the best way to generalize detecting uninitialized variables
   reliably in Bitcoin Core?

5. Extra credit: [can you improve the PR to run the tests in
   parallel](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17639#discussion_r354206723)
   in a way that prints generated suppressions to the user and does not
   potentially introduce false positives due to resource exhaustion?
