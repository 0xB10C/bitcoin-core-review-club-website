## Notes

- Compact blocks are a way to relay blocks across the Bitcoin P2P network with
  reduced bandwidth usage. They can also reduce block propagation latency when
  used in BIP152 _high-bandwidth_ mode.
  [BIP152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) is the
  specification for compact blocks.

- BIP152 was originally developed and deployed before segwit was activated;
  Bitcoin Core's implementation was merged in [PR
  8068](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8068) and included in the v0.13.0
  release. The specification was made extensible so that compact blocks could be
  used for non-witness serialized blocks (version 1) and witness serialized
  blocks (version 2).

- Segwit ([BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)) was
  activated in August 2017. Every version of Bitcoin Core since v0.13.1 supports
  segwit and will fully validate blocks according to the BIP141 consensus
  rules. To fully validate a block with segwit transactions, it must be
  serialized with witnesses.

- Version 1 (non-witness) compact blocks are therefore no longer useful to peers on the
  network. This PR removes support for serving version 1 compact blocks.

## Questions

1. How does using compact blocks save bandwidth? What data is not downloaded
   when relaying blocks using compact blocks?

2. What is BIP152 high-bandwidth mode? How many of our peers can we choose to be
   high-bandwidth peers?

3. How do we choose which peers should be high-bandwidth peers? In which
   function does that logic exist?

4. If a peer chooses us to be its high-bandwidth peer, how does it signal
   that to us?

5. BIP152 states: "high-bandwidth mode permits relaying of CMPCTBLOCK messages
   prior to full validation (requiring only that the block header is valid
   before relay)." In which `PeerManager` function do we relay compact blocks
   to peers that have chosen us to be a high-bandwidth peer?

6. How is that `PeerManager` function invoked? In which thread is it called?
