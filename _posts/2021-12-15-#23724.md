## Notes

- Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) allows us to hook into tracepoints during Bitcoin
  Core runtime. Once a tracepoint is reached, it can pass data about process internals to a
userspace script for further processing. This is great for observability and allows for debugging,
testing, and monitoring. See ["Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing support for Bitcoin
Core"](https://b10c.me/blog/008-bitcoin-core-usdt-support/) for more background information.

- Initial build support for tracepoints was added in
  [#19866](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19866). The tracepoints (e.g. `TRACE1(context,
  name, arg0)`) use (see
  [src/util/trace.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util/trace.h)) the
  `DTRACE_PROBE` macros (see
  [systemtap:includes/sys/sdt.h#L486](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=systemtap.git;a=blob;f=includes/sys/sdt.h;hb=209b5a19c6ee30c2db3f6c849620544a851013e8#l486))
  from [Systemtap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) under the hood.  This requires the `sys/sdt.h`
  header to be present during compilation.  If not present, `ENABLE_TRACING` will not be set to 1 in
  [`configure.ac`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/61b82a81751625b6bed81b9e0a281c5734e19c10/configure.ac#L1350-L1360),
  and no DTRACE_PROBE's are used.

- On Ubuntu/Debian, for example, the `sys/sdt.h` headers are included in the `systemtap-sdt-dev`
  package. If this package is installed, binaries with DTRACE_PROBE tracepoints will be built.
  Developers wanting to use the tracepoints can build the binaries themselves.

- However, tracepoints should ideally be included in release builds. This allows, for example,
  hooking into the tracepoints of production deployments. No custom binaries (which might behave
  differently) need to be compiled and deployed to trace Bitcoin Core.

- Tracepoints are NOPs in our Bitcoin Core binaries. As we make sure [not to include any additional
  expensive computations solely for the
  tracepoints](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#no-expensive-computations-for-tracepoints),
  there is only the minimal runtime overhead of the one NOP per tracepoint.

- This PR adds the Systemtap package to Bitcoin Core's depends system. GUIX builds for Linux
  platforms now contain tracepoints.

- We have discussed User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) in a [previous review
  club](/22006).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What do we need to have consensus on before this PR is merged?

3. Why can we skip `configure` and `make` for Systemtap? What are the problems?

4. Can you verify that the tracepoints are NOPs in the binaries? If yes, how?
