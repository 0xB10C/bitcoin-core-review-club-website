title: "#15204 Add Open External Wallet action (GUI)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15204](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15204)

## Notes

- This is the last PR in [a series of
  PRs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13059) to add all multiwallet
  functionality to the GUI (open wallet, close wallet and create wallet).
- A [previous PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15153) added the
  functionality to open wallets in the GUI. That was limited to opening
  wallets that were located in bitcoind's default wallet directory.
- This PR allows opening _external_ wallets, ie wallets that are located
  in locations other than the default wallet directory.
- Prior to [PR 11687](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687), wallets
  were created as individual `.dat` files (eg `wallet1.dat`, `wallet2.dat`,
  etc).  PR 11687 changed that to make wallet files directory-based (eg
  `wallet1/wallet.dat`, `wallet2/wallet.dat`, etc. That was done because
  the wallet creates several additional log and database files that need
  to be kept separately for separate wallets.
- This PR was marked for the [v0.19
  milestone](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/milestone/37), but has missed
  the feature freeze deadline.

## Questions

- The first commit in this PR refactors the `LoadWallet()` function. Why?
- How can this PR be tested (both manually and automatically)?
