title: "#15681 Allow one extra single-ancestor transaction per package (mempool)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681)

## Notes

- A *child transaction* is a transaction that spends one or more of the
  UTXOs from another transaction, called its *parent transaction.*  More
  generally, a *descendant transaction* spends a UTXO from a transaction
  that derives from one or more previous transactions, called *ancestor
  transactions.*

- In a valid Bitcoin block chain, parent transactions must appear before
  child transactions.  This makes sense: if a child transaction appeared
  first it'd be spending a UTXO that doesn't exist and so the child
  would be invalid.  As a corollary, all ancestor transactions must
  appear in the chain before any descendant.

- These ancestor rules make mining more complicated.  You can't just add
  any transaction to your block proposal---if you want to add a child
  transaction, you must first add any of its unconfirmed ancestors.
  Prior to [PR #7600][], this meant Bitcoin Core would only consider a
  child transaction for inclusion in a block if all of its parents were
  either part of the block chain (confirmed) or already paid high-enough
  feerates to be included in the block proposal on their own.
  
- That old mining strategy doesn't maximize profits for miners: if a
  child transaction pays enough fees, the average feerate of mining both
  transactions can be higher than the feerate of the parent alone.  In
  other words, the *Child Pays For [its] Parent* (CPFP).  This applies
  to longer sequences of ancestors as well.  CPFP is not only
  profit-maximizing for miners but it provides a method of fee bumping
  to users---users can create high-fee descendents in order to get
  low-feerate ancestors confirmed.

- To implement this profit-maximizing strategy, Bitcoin Core tracks
  transaction *packages*, which is the set of transactions that needs to
  be added to a block for any particular transaction to be confirmed,
  plus the overall size and average feerate of those packages.  You
  can see package information for your current mempool by running the
  following commend (warning: it'll take a while if your mempool has
  lots of transactions in it): `bitcoin-cli getrawmempool true`

- Calculating package information requires CPU and storing it requires
  memory.  Although the amounts of each resource used per transaction
  don't seem significant, it's worth noting that Bitcoin Core currently
  defaults to keeping up to about 100 blocks worth transactions in
  memory (several hundred thousand transactions), any of which might
  need to be updated when a new descendant arrives.
  
- To bound these costs, when CPFP mining (ancestor feerate mining) was
  implemented in [PR #7600][], it came with limits on the maximum number
  and size of related transactions that would be allowed into a
  package-using mempool.  The current limits are:

  ```text
  $ bitcoind -help-debug | grep -A3 -- -limit
    -limitancestorcount=<n>
         Do not accept transactions if number of in-mempool ancestors is <n> or
         more (default: 25)

    -limitancestorsize=<n>
         Do not accept transactions whose size with all in-mempool ancestors
         exceeds <n> kilobytes (default: 101)

    -limitdescendantcount=<n>
         Do not accept transactions if any ancestor would have <n> or more
         in-mempool descendants (default: 25)

    -limitdescendantsize=<n>
         Do not accept transactions if any ancestor would have more than <n>
         kilobytes of in-mempool descendants (default: 101).
  ```

- Because many transactions pay more than one person (even just by
  returning change back to the spender), the limits above are shared
  between users---which creates an opportunity for an DoS attack called
  [transaction pinning][].  Imagine Bob and Mallory each receive an
  output from a low-feerate transaction.  Mallory can create a child
  transaction that will get close enough to the `limitdescendantsize`
  limit that no further descendants will be accepted.

- As an attack, all transaction pinning does is prevent fee
  bumping---prevent anyone from accelerating the confirmation of a
  transaction.  For many transactions, blocking fee bumping doesn't
  matter much---Bitcoin users and businesses are very used to
  transactions going through slowly.  But for time-dependent contract
  protocols such as Lightning Network (LN) payment channels, a
  fee-bumping system that's not guaranteed to work in adversarial
  conditions is not safe enough to rely upon.

- This unsuitability of CPFP for fee bumping in adversarial conditions
  (and replace-by-fee, RBF, for its own self-imposed limits) is
  discouraging to LN developers because they encounter a special problem
  with fee management.  When an offchain LN transaction is created, the
  feerate necessary to ensure that transaction confirms within a
  reasonable number of blocks may be *x*; but if that transaction does
  actually need to be broadcast for onchain inclusion later, the feerate
  may then be *y*.  If *y* is greater than *x*, the transaction may not
  confirm in time---making theft possible.  If *x* is greater than *y*,
  then the users are overpaying fees.  The ideal case for LN users would
  be that they could create their offchain transactions paying a minimal
  fee and then use some sort of fee-bumping technique at the time the
  transaction was broadcast to set an appropriate fee then.

- The PR under discussion this week, which was also [suggested][cut out] by its
  author to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list and discussed there, is to
  allow the last transaction in a package to exceed the limits by a
  small amount if it has only one unconfirmed ancestor (an unconfirmed
  parent).  Given a proposed structure of LN transactions, this could
  make CPFP a reliable fee-bumping technique for LN.

## Questions

- Did the mailing list discussion reach a conclusive decision about this
  proposal?  Should we wait for it to do so before investing time
  reviewing the PR?

- Is it proper to be customizing mempool and relay logic for what seems
  to be a specific application?  How do we know that this doesn't hurt
  other applications?  Are we even sure that LN software will use CPFP
  if this change is adopted?  More generally, how do we go about
  answering these questions?

- What can we learn about creating good tests from [this
  part](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681#discussion_r270087859)
  of the discussion?

- Does this PR actually implement the same logic discussed on the
  mailing list?  If not, how does it differ and were those differences
  discussed anywhere public?
