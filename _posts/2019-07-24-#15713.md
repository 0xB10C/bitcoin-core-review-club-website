title: "#15713 refactor: Replace chain relayTransactions/submitMemoryPool by higher method (wallet)"

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15713](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15713)

## Notes

- The node-wallet interface was introduced in [PR
  14437](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14437). That PR added several
[interfaces](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e6e99d4f757f2e5052f0cc68951c75e91e4753e3/src/interfaces/README.md),
including the `Chain` interface, which is used by the wallet to access
blockchain and mempool state.
- PR 14437 and the following PRs
  ([14711](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14711),
[15288](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15288) and
[10973](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10973)) did not make
significant changes to which node functions the wallet could call. From the
code comments "TODO: Current chain methods are too low level, exposing too
much of the internal workings of the bitcoin node, and not being very
convenient to use. Chain methods should be cleaned up and simplified over
time."
- Since that PR was merged, several PRs have been opened and merged to
clean up and simplify the Chain interface:
  - [PR 15670](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15670) combined two
    interface methods `findFirstBlockWithTime` and
`findFirstBlockWithTimeAndHeight`
  - [PR 15842](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15842) replaced two
    interface methods `isPotentialtip` and `waitForNotifications` with a
higher-level method.
- this is the next PR in that sequence, and replaces two interface methods
  `relayTransactions` and `submitMemoryPool` with a higher-level method.
- the eventual end-point of this sequence of PRs is [PR
  16426](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426) which removes the
wallet's ability to directly lock `cs_main`. That PR also reverses the locking
order from `cs_main` before `cs_wallet` to `cs_wallet` before `cs_main`.
- This PR also impacts work to cleanly separate the node and wallet
  responsibilities for rebroadcasting transactions. See [issue
15734](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15734) for details.

## Questions

- Why is the wallet able to directly call functionality to broadcast
  transactions to peers?
- What is a transaction rebroadcast? How (and how often) are they currently
  triggered?
- What are some reasons that submitting a transaction to the mempool might
  fail?
- What do we mean by _locking order_? Why must locks always be acquired in the
  same order?
