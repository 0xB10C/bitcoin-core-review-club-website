title: "#15759 Add 2 outbound blocks-only connections (p2p)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759)

## Notes

- The Bitcoin P2P network serves 3 purposes:
  - relaying unconfirmed transactions
  - propagating blocks
  - gossiping addresses of known reachable nodes on the network
- (see the [btcinformation developer docs](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference#p2p-network) for documentation on P2P messages.)
- Although these three purposes share the same network, they have different design goals and properties. For example, transaction relay is optimized for a combination of redundancy/robustness as well as bandwidth minimization, while block relay is optimized to minimize delay.
- There's no reason these different purposes couldn't be split onto different networks, and in fact there already are specialized networks for block propagation such as [FIBRE](http://bitcoinfibre.org/) and [Blockstream satellite](https://blockstream.com/satellite/), and for transaction relay such as [TxTenna](https://txtenna.com/).
- Currently Bitcoin Core treats all peers as full network peers (tx, block and addr), unless you start your node in 'blocksonly' mode, in which case all peers are block/addr peers.
- The defaults for numbers of connections are 8 outbound and up to 125 total (ie up to 117 inbound connections if the node is a 'listening' node and is reachable).
- This PR proposes adding 2 additional blocks-only nodes, which would not relay txs or gossip addrs. The default connections would therefore be 8 full outbound, 2 blocks-only outbound, and up to 115 inbound.
- There are two main data structures that handle peer state: `CNode` (defined in `net.h` and covered by `cs_vNodes`) and `CNodeState` (defined in `netprocessing.cpp` and covered by `cs_main`).
- Roughly speaking, `CNode` is concerned with the _connection_ to the peer, and `CNodeState` is concerned with _application state_ of the peer. However, there is still some _application state_ contained in `CNode` for historic reasons. This should be moved out of `CNode` eventually.
- An example of the _application state_ data that is contained in `CNode` is the inventory data protected by `cs_inventory` (see [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adff8fe32101b2c007a85415c3ec565a7f137252/src/net.h#L716](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adff8fe32101b2c007a85415c3ec565a7f137252/src/net.h#L716)).
- One change in this PR is to move the tx relay inventory state into a separate structure (`TxRelay`) and only initializing it if the peer is a tx relay peer.

## Questions

- What problem is this PR addressing?
- Why is the tx relay inventory state moved into its own structure?
- How do we signal a 'blocks-only' connection on the P2P network?
- Why is the P2P behaviour of this PR difficult to test in the functional test framework?
- What does aj point out in his [review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#pullrequestreview-276960566) that all other reviewers missed?
- How should we handle peers that send us tx data after we've requested a blocks-only connection?
