title: "#16345 Add getblockbyheight method / #16439 support @height in place of blockhash for getblock etc (rpc)"

- [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16345](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16345)
- [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16439](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16439)

## Notes

- The `getblock` RPC method takes a block hash as its first argument.
- Users often want to get the block details for a block at a specific height, and so need to run `getblockhash <height>` and then `getblock <hash>` with the hash returned.
- There have been several user requests and PRs to change the `getblock` RPC to accept a block height and return information about that block at that height in the main chain.
  - [PR 8457](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8457)
  - [PR 14858](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14858)
  - [PR 16317](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16317)
- PR 16345 adds a new RPC method `getblockatheight`, which duplicates the logic in `getblock`, but takes a height instead of a block hash as its first argument.
- PR 16317 instead allows all RPC methods arguments that take a block hash to instead take a block height when prefixed with an `@` (eg `getblock @123456` would get information about the block at height 123456).

## Questions

- What other solutions have been proposed to this user request?
- What are the problems with overloading RPC arguments to be interpreted as different types?
- What test cases have been added to these two PRs? What additional test cases could be added?
- Which approach do you like best?
