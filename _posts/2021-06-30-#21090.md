## Notes

- Segwit was a softfork defined in [BIP
  141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), with
  P2P changes defined in [BIP
  144](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/65529b12bb01b9f29717e1735ce4d472ef9d9fe7/bip-0144.mediawiki).

- Segwit was activated at block 481,824 in August 2017. Prior to activation,
  some very careful testing was carried out to verify different scenarios, for
  example:

  - How are transactions and blocks relayed between unupgraded and upgraded
    nodes?
  - How do upgraded nodes find other upgraded nodes to connect to?
  - If a node is unupgraded at activation time and subsequently upgrades, how
    does it ensure that the blocks that it previously validated (without segwit
    rules) are valid according to segwit rules?

- To enable this kind of testing, [PR
  8418](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8418) made it possible to
  configure the segwit activation parameters using a `-bip9params`
  configuration option. That configuration option was later renamed to
  `-vbparams` in [PR 10463](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10463), and
  replaced with `-segwitheight` in [PR
  16060](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16060).

- Those options allowed starting a node which would never activate segwit by
  passing `-vbparams=segwit:0:0` (or later, `-segwitheight=-1`). This was used
  in the functional tests to test the node's behavior across activation.

- The segwit mainnet activation was a one-time event. Now that segwit has been
  activated, those tests are no longer required.

- This PR removes the final tests that made use of `-segwitheight=0`. With those
  tests removed, the special casing for `-segwitheight=-1` behavior can also be
  removed. That special casing impacted logic in net\_processing, validation and
  mining.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. This PR removed two subtests in `p2p_segwit.py`. What are those two
   subtests? What were they testing? Why can they now be removed?

3. What does the `CNode.GetLocalServices()` method do?

4. Why is this PR able to remove several calls to `GetLocalServices()`?

5. What does the
   [`GetBlockScriptFlags()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/567670bec5ecf9bc252e91370382be53fd81ccee/src/validation.cpp#L1661)
   function do?

6. Why is it ok to always set `SCRIPT_VERIFY_WITNESS` when `SCRIPT_VERIFY_P2SH`
   is set? (This isn't immediately obvious and will require some code/github
   archaeology!)

7. What does
   [`GenerateCoinbaseCommitment()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/567670bec5ecf9bc252e91370382be53fd81ccee/src/validation.cpp#L3125)
   do? Why is ok to remove the `consensusParams.SegwitHeight` check in that function?
