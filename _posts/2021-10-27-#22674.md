## Notes

* A **package** is an ordered list of transactions, representable by a Directed Acyclic Graph (a
  directed edge exists between a transaction that spends the output of another transaction).

* [Package Mempool Accept](https://gist.github.com/glozow/dc4e9d5c5b14ade7cdfac40f43adb18a) is a
  project implementing mempool validation and policy for packages. It is a prerequisite for [package
relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/package-relay/).

   - [PR #22674](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22674) is part of a series of PRs to
     implement this proposal. It implements validation and mempool submission of packages consisting
     of a single child with its unconfirmed parents.

   - Future work such as [PR #22290](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22290) will enable
     fee-bumping by CPFP and RBF within packages.

   - We have discussed Package Mempool Accept in previous review clubs, [#20833](/20833) and
     [#21800](/21800).

* If a node [sends a consensus-invalid
  transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/88fc7950f8db5f13a6b259819aced2e3db7ff4d8/src/net_processing.cpp#L1399)
or [violates P2P protocol](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/88fc7950f8db5f13a6b259819aced2e3db7ff4d8/src/net_processing.cpp#L3903-L3907), we should disconnect them in favor of nodes that are following network rules.  However, overzealous banning and disconnecting can lead to network partitions.

* When a transaction fails mempool validation, we categorize the failure as one of a few
  [`TxValidationResult`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/88fc7950f8db5f13a6b259819aced2e3db7ff4d8/src/consensus/validation.h#L24)
types. Most notably, we distinguish between consensus rule violations and local policy-based
rejections so that we can inform the P2P layer about peer misbehaviors (see
[`PeerManagerImpl::MaybePunishNodeForTx`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L1393-L1418)).
In a similar vein, this PR distinguishes between `PCKG_BAD` and `PCKG_POLICY`.

* Miners seek to maximize the total transaction fees while ensuring that their blocks are within
  consensus-enforced weight and sigops limits. To simplify this [2-dimensional
knapsack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Multi-dimensional_knapsack_problem) problem,
in the mempool, virtual size of a transaction is
[calculated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/94f83534e4b771944af7d9ed0f40746f392eb75e/src/policy/policy.cpp#L282)
as the maximum between its [BIP141 serialized
size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/1f0b563738199ca60d32b4ba779797fc97d040fe/bip-0141.mediawiki#transaction-size-calculations) and
its "sigop weight".

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What does `IsChildWithParents()` check? How does it do this?

3. What criteria must a package meet in order to be considered a child-with-unconfirmed-parents
package? Is it possible to verify without looking at the current chain? Is it possible to verify
without looking at our mempool?

4. How does this PR implement checking that a package is child-with-unconfirmed-parents? (Hint: code
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/306a0f6f14972d73281a022d67775a5485d563c7/src/validation.cpp#L1244-L1247)).
Why do we [add the child's
inputs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/306a0f6f14972d73281a022d67775a5485d563c7/src/validation.cpp#L1234-L1239) to `coins_to_uncache` beforehand?

5. Why do we distinguish between `PCKG_BAD` and `PCKG_POLICY`? Within this PR, do we do anything
differently based on the result type?

6. In what scenarios could the virtual sizes obtained from `GetVirtualTransactionSize()` [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/78d3665a6d9663cdad188243c6be7e8e9e9ece4e#diff-a58e7bb9d9a8a0287c0b7281d99da4e79b6f8c2a5780c24c6d76c14212c48640L981) and
the `MempoolAcceptResult` be different? (Hint: is it possible for the tx to be different? Is it
possible for `PreChecks` to calculate the virtual size differently?)

7. Quiz: given a multi-parent-1-child package of Tx1, Tx2, and Tx3 (where Tx3 is the child and there
are no dependencies between the parents), which of the following groups of transactions may be in
the mempool at the end of `ProcessNewPackage()`?

   ```
   (A) None
   (B) Tx1 only
   (C) Tx3 only
   (D) Tx1 and Tx2
   (E) Tx1 and Tx3
   (F) Tx1, Tx2 and Tx3
   ```

8. Under what circumstances is the "mempool full" error returned as the validation result for an individual
transaction? (Hint: the code is
[here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/88fc7950f8db5f13a6b259819aced2e3db7ff4d8/src/validation.cpp#L912))

9. [This code](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/b6b712fc599889b79151317289d2b172e1aa711b#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R1017)
prevents the `LimitMempoolSize()` from being called after each transaction is submitted.  What could
happen if we didn't do this?

10. [This commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/70c0f6b7a7e01ca4d7993ce08ba9b051d1175be5) adds a descendant limit for each transaction `Workspace` and changes the `MemPoolAccept`
limit to `const`. Given that our mempool policy does not change during a validation instance, how is
it possible for different transactions to have different descendant limits?
