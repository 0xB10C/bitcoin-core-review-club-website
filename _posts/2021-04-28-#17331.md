## Notes

- Wallets maintain their balance as a pool of Unspent Transaction Outputs
  (UTXOs). An
  [OutputGroup](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L72)
  collects all UTXOs that were sent to the same public key.

- _Coin selection_ refers to the process of picking UTXOs from the wallet's UTXO
  pool to fund a transaction.

- Beyond the primary goal of funding a transaction, the secondary goals of coin
  selection are:

    - Minimizing short term and long term fees:  
      We have to balance two needs: we want to pay the smallest fee now to get a
      timely confirmation, but we have to keep in mind that all of the wallet's
      UTXOs will need to be spent at some point. We shouldn't over-optimize
      locally at the detriment of large future costs. E.g. always using
      largest-first selection minimizes the current cost, but grinds the
      wallet's UTXO pool to dust.

    - Maintaining financial privacy:  
      There are a number of heuristics that tracking companies employ to cluster
      payments and addresses. For example, using inputs with the same output
      script in two transactions indicates that the two transactions involved
      the same party. Similarly, it is usually assumed that all inputs of a
      transaction were controlled by the same entity. Sometimes the privacy and
      economic considerations are opposed. If you want to understand privacy
      considerations better, check out the [Privacy
      article](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy) on the Bitcoin wiki.

    - Reliably move the payment(s) to finalization:  
      Using unconfirmed inputs can make transactions unreliable. Unconfirmed
      transactions received from another wallet may time out or be replaced,
      making those funds disappear. Even using self-sent unconfirmed funds may
      delay the new transaction if the parent transaction has an extensive
      ancestry, is extraordinarily large, or used a lower feerate than targeted
      for the child transaction.

- The process of creating a transaction in Bitcoin Core's wallet roughly
  follows these steps:

    1. `CreateTransaction()` builds the header and recipient outputs, i.e. the
       parts of the transaction that will remain fixed throughout the coin
       selection process.

    2. The `long_term_feerate`, `effective_feerate`, and `discard_feerate` are
       established using `GetMinimumFeeRate()` which falls back either to fee
       estimation or user input. The feerates remain constant for the remaining
       process. The amount to be raised from the inputs, `nTargetValue` is
       calculated from the sum of recipient amounts, the target feerate, and the
       size of the fixed transaction parts.

    3. The wallet's UTXO pool is retrieved via `AvailableCoins()`.

    4. Using the above fixed values, `SelectCoins()` is used to pick an input
       set to fund the transaction. If the user manually selected some UTXOs by
       means of the `CoinControl` feature, these UTXOs are used first. The
       remaining UTXOs are grouped into `OutputGroup`s. The grouped UTXOs are
       then used in one or multiple rounds of `SelectCoinsMinConf()`, using
       increasingly permissive `CoinEligibilityFilter`s to preselect
       `OutputGroup`s until an input set is found.

    5. Determine whether to create a change output, finish assembling the
       transaction, and sign the transaction.

- When a UTXO is selected as an input, the size of the transaction is increased
  which in turn increases the necessary fees to maintain the targeted feerate.
  We can preempt the cost added by the input by considering each UTXO at its
  _effective value_, its value reduced by the UTXO's input cost at the given
  feerate.

- Bitcoin Core currently uses two different solvers:

    - The _knapsack solver_ sorts the available UTXOs by effective value, and
      then combines candidate input sets by randomly selecting or skipping
      inputs until it has sufficient funds for the transaction. When it finds a
      viable solution, it keeps the solution if it produces a smaller change
      than the prior stored solution. Then, the algorithm deselects the last
      input and continues traversing the UTXO list as described, trying to
      converge on the smallest change output above `MIN_CHANGE`. This random
      process is repeated up to 1,000 times.

    - The _Branch and Bound solver (BnB)_ deterministically searches the
      complete combination space to find an input set that will avoid the
      creation of a change output. It performs a depth-first search on a binary
      tree where each branch represents the inclusion or exclusion of a UTXO,
      exploring inclusion branches first, and backtracking whenever a subtree
      cannot yield a solution.  It returns the first discovered input set that
      is an _exact match_ for the funding requirement of the transaction. The
      qualifier _"exact match"_ here refers here to an input set that overshoots
      the `nTargetValue` by less than the cost of a change output.  The BnB
      algorithm is not guaranteed to find a solution even when there are
      sufficient funds since an _exact match_ may not exist.

- Using _effective values_ in coin selection means that we can freely add and
  remove inputs until we have have raised enough funds to pay for the
  transaction's fixed costs: the payment amounts, the transaction header and the
  output data. Whatever final input set we settle for, the increased transaction
  size and input costs have already been accounted for.

- [PR #17331](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17331) implements the use
  of _effective values_ across all different coin selection strategies. Prior,
  it was only used for the BnB selection where it facilitated the search to be
  effectively performed. Introducing _effective values_ into the knapsack solver
  means it no longer works on a moving target, and thus only needs to be run
  once. It also allows some of the pre-selection steps to be shared between BnB
  and knapsack.

- This PR also changes the behavior of `SelectCoinsMinConf()` to try BnB first
  and then attempt knapsack only in the case that BnB did not find an input set.
  Before this PR, the function would only run one or the other strategy
  controlled by the boolean flag `use_bnb`.

## Questions

1. How does the _effective value_
   [differ](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/453c00c8eaffb7ee16b3b3232a6c3e39b1b52882#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R2473)
   from the `nValue` of a UTXO?

2. What is
   [`not_input_fees`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/453c00c8eaffb7ee16b3b3232a6c3e39b1b52882#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R2402)?
   What does this help with?

3. What happens when
   [`m_subtract_fee_outputs`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/453c00c8eaffb7ee16b3b3232a6c3e39b1b52882#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R2473)
   is true?

4. What does
   [`cost_of_change`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/453c00c8eaffb7ee16b3b3232a6c3e39b1b52882#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R2416)
   represent? How do we know the `cost_of_change` in advance?

5. What are [`long_term_feerate`,
   `effective_feerate`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.h#L611),
   and
   [`discard_feerate`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.h#L69)?

6. Why are the `OutputGroup`s calculated separately for
   [BnB](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2415)
   and
   [knapsack](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2420)?

7. What purpose did the
   [while-loop](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/23c85ae91ea0a720b591cab8dfd20be72425ab31#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8L2856)
   in `CreateTransaction()` serve? Why is it safe to remove it?

8. Under which circumstances do resulting transactions not create a change
   output? (Hint: there are [two
   cases](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9914d845aaea5804af4801ffec53c701/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2919))
