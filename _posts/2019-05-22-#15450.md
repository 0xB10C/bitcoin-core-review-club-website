title: "#15450 [GUI] Create wallet menu option (GUI)"
---

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15450)

## Notes

- Bitcoin uses QT for its GUI. The minimum version is 5.5. [Online documentation](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.5/index.html).
- This PR is one of the last in a series of multiwallet PRs. The first of those was [#8694](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8694) which added multiwallet support through the RPC interface and was merged in June 2017.
- Adding the various multiwallet functions (create/open/close wallet) at runtime is tracked by [Issue 13059](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13059).
- We already have UI support for opening and closing wallets. This PR adds UI support for creating wallets.
- Creating wallets dynamically is relatively new functionality (merged in [#13058](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13058) in June 2018). There have been a couple of additional options added to the `createwallet` RPC since it was added: [Disable private keys](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9662), [Blank wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15226) and [born-encrypted wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15006).
- This PR was opened before the born-encrypted wallets PR was merged, so potentially could be simplified now that the functionality exists within the wallet component.
- For GUI PRs, I always like to build and manually test the PR to get a sense of what the new UI functionality feels like. If you're testing on the same machine that you run your mainnet node on, REMEMBER TO MOVE OR BACKUP YOUR WALLET/DATADIR BEFORE TESTING!
- Feel free to leave feedback on UI PRs about usability as well as comments on the code.
